        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Simple to make and a great little loaf.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups S/R Flour</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>80g Butter, chilled, cubed</li>
            <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200C. Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper. Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Add the water to the flour mixture and use a knife to mix in a cutting motion, until the mixture <em>just</em> comes together. Add 1-2 extra tbsp of water if the mixture is a little dry. Then use your hands to gently bring it together.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Shape into a 18cm disc and place on tray. Use a knife that has been dipped in flour to mark 8 wedges on top. Dust the damper with a little extra flour and bake in the oven for 30 mins or until it is cooked through and sounds hollow when tapped on the base. Transfer to a wire rack for 5 mins to cool slightly. Serve warm.</li>
